# PSoC&trade; 4: CAPSENSE&trade; Pipeline scan and process

This code example demonstrates how to implement pipeline scanning in CAPSENSE&trade; to improve performance. When a particular widget is being processed, the next widget in line can be scanned in parallel, and the device remains in Deep Sleep mode until the scan is complete. The WDT (Watchdog Timer) is used to wake up the device periodically from Deep Sleep mode. This is better than the traditional method of scanning all the widgets and then processing the scanned data later. This reduces the sensor scan time and minimizes power consumption.

</details>


## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE </b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
	  
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   
   </details>
   
   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile, but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

3. After programming, the application starts automatically. The status of the on-board user buttons can be visually observed through their corresponding on-board user LEDs. By default or during a no-press condition, LEDs are turned OFF. A button press or slider segment press is visually indicated by turning ON the corresponding LED.

4. You can implement the same design process in your application. The higher the number of sensors in the application, the more noticeable and faster the response.

### Monitor data using CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner

1. Launch the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner from the 'BSP Configurators' section in the IDE **Quick Panel** to monitor the CAPSENSE&trade; data.

2. Ensure that the kits are in CMSIS-DAP Bulk mode (KitProg3 Status LED is ON and not blinking). See [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) to learn how to update the firmware and switch modes in KitProg3.

3. In the tuner application, click on the **Tuner communication setup** icon or select **Tools** > **Tuner Communication Setup**. In the window that appears, select the I2C checkbox under KitProg3 and configure it as follows:

   - **I2C address: 8**
   - **Sub-address: 2-Bytes**
   - **Speed (kHz): 400**

    These are the same values set in the EZI2C resource.

   **Figure 1. Tuner communication setup parameters**
	
   ![](images/tuner-communication-setup-parameters.png)
	
4. Click **Connect** or select **Communication** > **Connect** to establish a connection.

   **Figure 2. Establish connection**
   
   ![](images/establish-connection.png)

5. Click **Start** or select **Communication** > **Start** to start data streaming from the device.
 
   **Figure 3. Start tuner communication**
  
   ![](images/start-tuner-communication.png)

6. Set the **Read mode** to Synchronized mode. Navigate to the **Widget view** tab and notice that the **Button0** widget is highlighted in blue when you touch it.

   **Figure 4. Widget View tab of the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner**
  
   ![](images/widget-view.png)

7. The Tuner GUI displays the data from the sensor in the **Widget View** and **Graph View** tabs.

## Scan architecture

Pipeline scanning is a technique to scan and process widgets in parallel rather than sequentially scanning all the sensors/widgets and then processing them altogether. A faster method is when the CAPSENSE&trade; controller scans a particular widget while the previous widget is processed by the processor and the device is put into Deep Sleep until the scan is complete. The WDT (Watchdog Timer) is used to wake up the device periodically from Deep Sleep. This reduces the total effective scan time and minimizes the power consumption of the application.

A comparison between the two scanning methods is shown in **Figure 5**.

**Figure 5. Scan flow for pipeline and sequential scan methods**

![](images/scan_architecture.png)

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.

</details>

**Note:** For all kits, the debug port is by default disabled in order to achieve low power. If debugging is required, do the following:

1. Enable the **Debug mode** under the **Systems** tab in the **Device Configurator** and change the **Debug mode** setting to **SWD**.

2. Select the pins P3[2] (SWDIO) and P3[3] (SWDCK) under the **SWD pin** setting.

3. Select the Drive mode of both the pins as "Strong Drive,Input buffer on" under the **Pins** tab in the **Device Configurator**.

## Design and implementation

The project contains multiple button widgets and a slider widget configured in CSD sensing mode. See the "CAPSENSE&trade; CSD sensing method" section in the [AN85951 – PSoC&trade; 4 and PSoC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.infineon.com/AN85951)  for details on CAPSENSE&trade; CSD and CSX sensing modes. 

The sensing elements are mapped to the on-board user buttons and segments of the slider. The status of an on-board user button is conveyed by controlling the LED state. The LED turns ON when a button press is registered and remains OFF when the button is not pressed.

Refer [PSoC&trade; 4 MCU: CAPSENSE&trade; CSD button tuning](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-capsense-csd-button-tuning) code example to tune CSD sensors and refer [PSoC&trade; 4 MCU: CAPSENSE&trade; CSX button tuning](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-capsense-csx-button-tuning) code example to tune CSX sensors.

The WDT in PSoC&trade; 4 is a 16-bit timer and uses the internal low-speed oscillator (ILO) clock of 40 kHz as a source. The accuracy of ILO is (- 50% to +100%). Therefore, the match value of WDT is set after compensating the ILO with IMO. The firmware flow is as follows:

1. Enable the ILO, which is the source for the WDT. Start ILO measurement and get the value of `ilo_compensated_counts` which must be set after every interrupt match.

2. Write the match value. The WDT can generate an interrupt when the WDT counter reaches the match count. The match count is generated using `DESIRED_WDT_INTERVAL`.

3. Enable interrupt generation and assign the interrupt service routine(`wdt_isr`).

4. Enable the WDT. Because the ILO has low accuracy, the `ilo_compensated_counts` are calculated, and the match value of the WDT is updated following a WDT interrupt.

5. The System is put into Deep Sleep in idle mode to save power. Because the watchdog timer works on a low-frequency clock (LFCLK), its operation will not be affected when the system is put into Deep Sleep mode. The watchdog timer interrupt will wake the device from Deep Sleep mode.

**Note:**

1. The WDT is configured to generate interrupts at `WDT_INTERRUPT_INTERVAL_MS` intervals. The default value of `WDT_INTERRUPT_INTERVAL_MS` is 10 ms. The WDT generates an interrupt on reaching the match value. The WDT counter is not reset on a match; it continues to count across the full 16-bit resolution. Therefore, the new match value of the WDT counter is generated and updated on every WDT interrupt event to generate an interrupt after the present interrupt. The WDT interrupt flag is set inside the WDT interrupt service routine; it is checked in the main loop.

2. You can configure the values of the WDT interrupt interval and WDT interrupt priority using macros in main.c as shown in **Figure 6** and update them.

   **Figure 6. Accessing macros**

   ![](images/accessing-macros.png)

### Set up the VDDA supply voltage and Debug mode in the Device Configurator

1. Open the Device Configurator from the **Quick Panel**.

2. Navigate to the **System** tab. Select the **Power** resource and set the VDDA value under **Operating conditions**.

3. By default, SWD pins are active in all device power modes. Disable **Debug mode** to disable SWD pins and thereby reduce power consumption as follows:
